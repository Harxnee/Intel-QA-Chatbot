{"question": "Who does GDPR apply to and why is it important?", "answer": "GDPR applies to any organization functioning within the European Union (EU), as well as any organizations functioning outside the EU that offer goods or services to customers or businesses within the EU.

{"question": "What are Kudos?", "answer": "Kudos is a content rating system that lets you vote for the messages you think are the most useful or important.

{"question": "How can I see who's given me Kudos?", "answer": "Want to know who thinks a message is good?

Click the Kudos total. The Who Kudoed this Message page shows you all the community members who've given kudos to the message. Click Experts to see kudos given by high-ranking members of the community. Experts are usually moderators and other users who had a kudos weight of more than 1 when they gave the message kudos.

To see all of your recent kudos activity in an area, click view all. Click the tabs to see more info about your kudos activity."}
{"question": "What is Kudos weight?", "answer": "Your kudos weight is the number of kudos you give each time you click Kudos!.

More experienced community members might have a higher kudos weight, so they could give two kudos, ten kudos, or more each time they click."}
{"question": "Why can't I give Kudos to some messages?", "answer": "There are a few reasons why you might not be able to give Kudos to a post. You've already given Kudos to this message (you can only give them once). You wrote the message (you can't Kudo your own messages). Your community manager wants you to give Kudos only to a message that starts a thread and not to replies. Your community manager has turned Kudos off for a message or a forum. Your community manager has frozen Kudos for this message. You can still see how many Kudos the message has received, but you can't Kudo it any more."}
{"question": "Where did the Kudos number go?", "answer": "Sometimes a message gets so many kudos that we run out of space to show the number. When that happens, you'll see a Hot Kudos symbol or icon instead of the kudos count on the kudos badge."}
{"question": "What is a tag?", "answer": "A tag is a single keyword or phrase that describes the topic, theme, or subject of a post. You can add as many tags as you want and so can other community members. For example, in a post about a mouse, you might add these tags: mouse, USB mouse, optical mouse, wireless, DPI. Be sure to use commas between tags."}
{"question": "What is a tag cloud?", "answer": "A tag cloud displays tags used frequently within the community or within an area of the community. The more frequently a tag is used, the larger it appears in the tag cloud. By looking at a tag cloud, you can get a sense of what the hot topics are in a given area."}
{"question": "What can I do with tags?", "answer": "Tagging is a way to help other users discover interesting posts. It's also a way to organize content in the community that you think is related. When you apply tags to a post, you add to the value by providing another way for people to find it."}
{"question": "Why do people tag?", "answer": "Some users will tag posts for their own convenience in finding them later. Other users enjoy helping categorize interesting posts for the benefit of the community. Users who tag lots of posts gain status by appearing on Tag Leaderboards."}
{"question": "How do I tag?", "answer": "To add a tag: Navigate to an interesting post or comment. Click in the Add field and type your tags (separated by commas). Click Add Tag."}
{"question": "Where are my tags?", "answer": "You can find messages you've tagged by visiting your profile and clicking the tag. You can also click on a tag on any cloud and look at the Most Tagged section."}
{"question": "What are labels?", "answer": "Labels are used within a community to help categorize articles in a variety of discussion styles; forums, blogs, Q&A, ideas, TKBs. Labels enable you to categorize the content you write based on the themes or content in the article. For example, in a support Q&A for troubleshooting connectivity issues with your smart phone, you might apply labels like \"iPhone\", \"Galaxy\", \"AT&T\", or \"Verizon\". Unlike tags, labels are created by the Community Admin and typically controlled for consistency and need. Authors must choose/apply labels from a pre-defined list for the node in which the article appears. Tags are more freeform and can be created by authors."}
{"question": "How do I add a label to my post?", "answer": "To add a label: Navigate to the post you authored. Open the post to edit it. In the Labels field, start typing the label or choose one from the list. If you add multiple labels, you must separate them with commas."}
{"question": "Who can create labels?", "answer": "Typically, only administrators or permissioned members can create new labels or edit the label list. When the use of labels is enforced, members must apply a label when submitting posts. Labels can be optionally predefined, giving administrators complete control over exactly which labels are used in their community. Labels are applied at node (board) level, so different settings can be applied at different boards. One board might be mandatory with a predefined pool of labels, while another can be completely optional and enable users to create their own labels."}
{"question": "How do I subscribe to a label?", "answer": "When you subscribe to a label, you will be notified by email when a new post is created with the label. To subscribe to a label: From a particular post with a label, click on the label to filter by that label. (You can also do this from the labels component.) Click Subscribe. Note:Your community users can configure their own subscription settings under My Settings > Subscriptions and Notifications > My Subscriptions and My Settings > Subscriptions and Notifications > Notification Settings. One thing to note about labels is that they are applied at node level. Thus, predefined labels and subscriptions to labels exist only at the node at which they are applied. For example, if you subscribe to a label named 'contest' at board 1, it will not automatically subscribe you to an identically named label at board 2. You will have to subscribe twice, once at each board. This also applies if you add a labels component to your page to display the most popular labels, these are also designed to work at node level."}

{"question": "Why do I keep getting password incorrect or invalid messages when signing in?", "answer": "If you are receiving “Your account or password is incorrect. If you don’t remember your password, reset it now”, then you have been redirected to your company to authenticate because you have access to confidential information at Intel. These credentials are not stored or managed at Intel. If your company has not configured their Azure Portal sign-in screen, it will say Intel Azure Portal, but it is your company you are authenticating with. Please use the work email address that you use to log in to your company PC or Microsoft 365 account – NOT the email address you have used to register with Intel as your company authentication might be different. If you cannot reset or request your password, it is recommended to contact your IT department to request a reset for your internal company password.
